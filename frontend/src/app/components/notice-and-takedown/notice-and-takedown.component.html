    <h3>DMCA Takedown Policy</h3>
    <p>
        Welcome to Musica's Guide to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). If you've received a DMCA takedown notice targeting content you've posted on Musica or if you're a rights-holder looking to issue such a notice, this page will hopefully help to.
        This guide isn't legal advice and shouldn't be taken as such.

    <h4>What is the DMCA</h4>
    <p>
        The DMCA is a copyright liability safety net for internet service providers hosting allegedly infringing user-generated content. Essentially, so long as a service provider follows the DMCA's notice-and-takedown rules, it won't be liable for copyright
        infringement based on user-generated content. </p>
